Build [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md):

- Setup the repo for the Go implementation and any necessary dependencies
- Start building starting with the test harness and tests
- Build fully TDD, run tests as you keep implementing until you have completed everything in the SPEC.

Use latest features of Go wherever it makes sense and best practices + latest dependencies (feel free to check versions). We're on Go 1.26.0 right now.

Do not stop working until the SPEC is fully implemented and tested.
