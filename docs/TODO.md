- add an interactive command to inspect existing projects and their states visually (in a list/table), and fix any issues by selecting the desired action for each one. Switching between available "fix" actions that make sense for a given repo - ignore / push / stage all + commit + push / maybe some other ones - (can you suggest more "fixes"?) - and these auto-fix options show up only if it's possible - e.g. not if repo is in a state where that's not possible, e.g. during rebase. These fixes should also be possible to do from the CLI by calling `bb fix ${project}` (shows what fix is possible if needed), then run `bb fix ${project} ${name-of-fix}` to apply it.
